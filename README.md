==============

Autobiographical data visualization of my last.fm listening history from January 2009 to January 2013. My top 40 artists are displayed in a [streamgraph](http://www.leebyron.com/else/streamgraph/) with most listened-to at the top. The x-axis represents time and the vertical thickness of a stream represents total plays of an artist in a given month.
